                     <h2>Game Summary!</h2>
                     <p>
                     In the faraway island of Fungi, there dwells a humble population of villagers living 
                     in four villages that are located at each compass direction on the island.  
                     The island villagers would be living a satisfied, happy life if not for the 
                     invading Saladorians led by the ruthless Saladore The Tyrant who conquered each 
                     of the villages and forced the inhabitants to obey his every rule.  
                     To combat this threat, two heroes have risen among their fellow citizens 
                     to take down these enemies. Will Mushronian and Amanita be able to vanquish their foes 
                     or will they succumb to the iron fist of the Saladorians?!
                     </p>
              </div>
              <div id="help">
                     <h2>Reset Database Button</h2>
                     <p>
                            The “Reset Entire Database” button will reset the database to the starting state for the game.  It is highly recommended to click this button before starting the game, as otherwise, you may start where another player left off, which will be entirely confusing.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Using Query Bar</h2>
                     <p>
                            The Query Bar allows users experienced in SQL to search for information in the FungIsle database. To run the query, simply press "submit." To clear the query bar, press "erase." The Query Bar only has select access, so you will not be able to update, delete, or otherwise change the database.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Using the Scavenge Feature</h2>
                     <p>
                            To recover their health, our heroes and their pets eat mushrooms that grow on the island. Simply choose your character or animal and press "scavenge" to send them out to explore the island. There are several different mushroom types that your hero or animal could collect, but they all recover 100 health, except for the Almighty mushroom which recovers 1000 health. Should you be lucky enough to be graced with its presence, you can recover the entire health of a hero. 
                            Note: heroes can only hold up to five mushrooms of each type in their backpack, and animals can carry only up to two.                             
                     </p>
                     <h2>Using the Eat Mushroom Feature</h2>
                     <p>
                            Use this feature to recover the health of your characters, simply choose your hero or animal and then choose from the list of possible mushrooms that they have. If your character eats a mushroom while at full or near-full health, their health will not recover, but they will still eat it anyway. Also, if your hero is dead, your character will be unable to eat – with the exception of the Almighty Mushroom which can revive a character.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Using the Attack Feature</h2>
                     <p>
                            The attack feature is the most powerful and most complex feature of this game. As the official tactician for Mushronian and Amanita, it your job to communicate with them where to go, and who to attack. Both heroes start at their base, but you can send either of them (one at a time) to any of the four lands. Once all four lands have been freed (i.e., all the Saladorian Henchmen in each land are defeated), you can direct the heroes to Hell's Cave to fight off Saladore himself! Obviously, it is helpful to use the query bar to get more information into the exact details of each hero, but you can learn the game’s dynamics easily enough. Both heroes can be in the same village at once, but only one hero can attack at a time. In addition, all Saladorians in each village will attack a hero that attacks any one of them, so be careful! Heroes use their vehicles to travel, but those vehicles' stats do not affect the heroes' stats.  Also, all humans have an attack and defense multiplier which is a number that is multiplied by their weapon's stats for their dmg/def. Defense effectively cancels damage against a human. A hero who attacks Saladorians in a village may not leave until they have defeated all resident Saladorians. Once a hero dies, they will be unable to do anything. If a hero has an animal or pet, they can be used to add damage to an attack, but they cannot contribute defense or take damage.
