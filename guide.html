                     <h2>Game Summary!</h2>
                     <p>
                     In the faraway island of Fungi, there dwells a humble population of villagers living 
                     in four villages that are located at each compass direction on the island.  
                     The island villagers would be living a satisfied, happy life if not for the 
                     invading Saladorians led by the ruthless Saladore The Leafy who conquered each 
                     of the villages and forced the inhabitants to obey his every rule.  
                     To combat this threat, two heroes have risen among their fellow citizens 
                     to take down these enemies. Will Mushronian and Amanita be able to vanquish their foes 
                     or will they succumb to the iron fist of the Saladorians?!

                     <h2>Using Query Bar</h2>
                     <p>
                     The Query Bar allows users experience with SQL to search for information in the FungIsle database.
                     To run the query, simply press "submit." To clear the query bar, press "erase.''
                     </p>
                     <h2>Using Attack Lists</h2>
                     <p>
                     As the official tactician for Mushronian and Amanita, it your job to communicate with them where to go,
                     and who to attack.  Both heroes start at their base, but you can send either of them (one at a time) to
                     any of the four lands.  Once all four lands have been freed (i.e. all the Saladorian Henchmen in each
                     land are defeated), you can direct the heroes to Hell's Cave to fight off Saladore himself! Obviously,
                     it is helpful to use the query bar to get more information into the exact details of each hero, but you
                     can get the main gist fairly easily. Both heroes can be in the same land at once, but only one hero can attack
                     at once.  In addition, all Saladorians (due to their radios) will attack a hero that attacks any one of them, so be careful!
                     Heroes use their vehicles to travel, but their stats do not affect them.  Because heroes must fight hand to hand,
                     they have to jump out of their vehicle and hence the vehicle's stats don't affect them.  All humans have an
                     attack and defense multiplier which is a number that is multiplied by their weapon's stats for their dmg/def.  Def
                     effectively cancels dmg against a human. A hero who attacks Saladorians in a village, may not leave until they 
                     have defeated all resident Saladorians.  Once a hero dies, they will be unable to do anything.  If a hero has an animal
                     or pet, they can be used to add on dmg to an attack, but they cannot contribute defense or take dmg.
