# FungIsle
CIS 451 Final Project

Visit: https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~kaisers/FungIsle/index.html to see website in total action

The whole program is almost entirely php with html/css for basic frontend
All changes are made to db, so if multiple users use the application at once, it'll throw things out of whack.
Press "reset" to ensure that db is correct, but you could, once again, reset other user haha.
