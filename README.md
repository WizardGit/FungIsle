# FungIsle
CIS 451 Final Project

Visit: https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~kaisers/FungIsle/phps/index.php to see the website in total action

The whole program is almost entirely php with html/css for basic frontend
All changes are made to db, so if multiple users use the application at once, changes can write over others, but as no one else is using the website you should be just fine.
Press "reset" to ensure that db is correct (at its default).
